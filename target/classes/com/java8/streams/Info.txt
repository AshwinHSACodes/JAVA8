Intermediate and terminal operations.

Terminal operations are used to produce a result, and after that, you cannot reuse them.

Streams leave source collection intact, i.e. operations on streams don't affect the collection from which streams are obtained.
You can get Stream not just from the Collection but from other sources like Random Number generator and FileInputStream.
